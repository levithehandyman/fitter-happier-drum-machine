A drum machine.

## dev setup

Clone this repo.

Install NVM:

win: <https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows>

macOS: <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>

Run `nvm use` in this directory on the command line (on Windows this command might be
`nvm install`). The file `.nvmrc` contains the version of Node.js this project
expects (15.7.0).

Run `npm install`

## write code

Run `npm start`

## build code

Run `npm run build`

NOTE: This outputs the bundle to the root of the project so Github pages will
work correctly. After you make code changes, you'll need to run the build and
commit the result.
